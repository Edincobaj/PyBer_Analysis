# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis

As a data analyst at PyBer, you've been asked by the CEO, V. Isualize, to analyze all the rideshare data from January to early May 2019 and create a compelling visualization. Using our Python skill and knowledge of Pandas we'll create dataframes to allow us see the data by city type. We'll then create a multiple-line graph to show the weekly fares for each city type then submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results

Taking a look at the summary dataframe we created in deliverable 1, we can see several differences between each city type.

- Urban cities have the highest total rides, total drivers, and total fares followed by Suburban and Rural.
- Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and average fare per driver followed by Suburban and Urban.
